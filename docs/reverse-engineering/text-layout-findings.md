# Native text layout inputs and defaults

Inspected Samsung Notes 4.4.45.37 ARM64 libraries in
`scratch/apk-analysis-native/arm64-v8a` and matching decompiled SDK sources.
Addresses below belong to the named library. These are native implementation
findings, not a claim that the SDK matches Samsung typography visually. The
[standalone text findings](text-box-findings.md) describe the shared `TextCommon`
serialization; [PDF export findings](pdf-export-findings.md) describe the captured
body-text reference.

## Text defaults and range application

`libSPenWidget` exports `ObjectTextLayout::DEFAULT_FONT_COLOR` at `0x66410`;
`libSPenDrawing` exports `ObjectTextDrawing::DEFAULT_FONT_COLOR` at `0x52b24`.
Both contain bytes `26 26 26 ff`, or ARGB `0xFF262626`.

This value is used, not merely an unused exported constant. Widget
`ObjectTextLayout::updateSpan`, `0xd4fc4`–`0xd4fd0`, and Drawing
`ObjectTextDrawing::UpdateSpan`, `0x8d08c`–`0x8d098`, pass it through context
virtual slot 80 with usage value 3. They store the returned color into each
text slot at `0xd4ffc` and `0x8d0c8`, before applying stored styles. The context
may transform the color for a theme; the constant is the untransformed default.
The decompiled `composer_def_font_color` resource is `#252525` in
`resources/res/values/colors.xml`. A UI or zero-length caret style using that
resource does not replace the native rendered-text default, or define stroke
ink color.

The same initialization uses `(17 + font_size_delta) * resolved_scale` as its
default font size: Widget `0xd4fdc`–`0xd4ff8`, Drawing `0x8d0a8`–`0x8d0c4`.
Widget also exports `ObjectTextLayout::DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE` at `0x6640c` with
the integer bytes `11 00 00 00` (17).
The resolved scale comes from context and text-scale state; these functions do
not establish that every document uses a universal factor of 3.

Stored styles then apply to the intersection of their half-open UTF-16 range
and the requested text interval. Widget `convertTextSpan`, `0xd56b8`, clamps
the endpoints at `0xd5794`–`0xd57a0`, skips an empty intersection at
`0xd57a4`–`0xd57a8`, and applies the style to each selected slot at
`0xd57c8`–`0xd57ec`. Drawing repeats this at `0x8d6c4`–`0x8d71c`.
The source list is traversed in order; subsequent assignments can replace
earlier values for the same field. A `start == end` style has no rendered
characters in this path. Preserve it as editing metadata without promoting
it to a whole-box style.

Widget `TextLayoutUtil::ConvertFontSizeSpan`, `0xdb794`, preserves start/end
and interval flags and computes `max(1, stored_size + font_size_delta) *
text_scale` at `0xdb800`–`0xdb808`. No upper-size clamp appears in that
conversion. `TextLayoutUtil::SetFromObject`, `0xdae94`, transfers the text,
all ordinary spans, separate font-size spans, paragraphs, gravity and ellipsis
settings to a `TextLayout`. A shared Rust input adapter should preserve these
inputs instead of choosing the first style of each kind for the entire box.

## Margins and vertical gravity

`SetFromObject` multiplies left/top/right/bottom margins by its supplied
`text_scale` at `0xdaf04`, `0xdaf10`, `0xdaf1c`, `0xdaf24`, then calls
`TextLayout::SetMargin` at `0xdaf38`. Keep coordinate conversion explicit;
margin values and output SVG coordinates are not interchangeable.

`SpenObjectShape.java:41-43` defines gravity as `TOP=0`, `CENTER=1`,
`BOTTOM=2`. These are a small enum, not Android gravity bit flags.
Text `RichTextDrawing::UpdateGravityOffsetY`, `0x6489c`, reads that enum at
`0x648c0` and assigns:

| Value | Vertical offset |
| --- | --- |
| 0 or another value | 0 |
| 1 | `max(0, (available_height - content_height) / 2)` |
| 2 | `max(0, available_height - content_height)` |

The calculation and stores are at `0x6493c`–`0x64958`. Nonempty content uses
the drawing's measured height. Empty content uses `RichText::GetTextSize(0)`
plus top/bottom margins, `0x6490c`–`0x64930`; it is not treated as zero-height
content. Wrapping and measurement must precede gravity positioning.

## Paragraphs and line spacing

Decompiled `SpenAlignmentParagraph.java:8-11` defines left/right/center/both
as 0/1/2/3. `SpenIndentLevelParagraph.java:7-10` defines none/LTR/RTL as
0/1/2; these differ from deprecated text-box direction constants. Paragraph
records select paragraph ordinals, whereas style spans select UTF-16 offsets.

Widget `TextLayoutUtil::GetParagraphCount`, `0xda9c0`, walks `String::GetChar`
and recognizes CR and LF at `0xdaaec`–`0xdaaf8`. Each is processed separately;
this routine does not coalesce a CRLF pair. Empty text returns one paragraph
at `0xdac70`. A newline at index zero replaces its initial boundary with -1
at `0xdab04`–`0xdab18`, retaining the leading empty paragraph. Base
`String::GetChar`, `0xc470c`, reads a 16-bit unit at `buffer + index * 2`
(`0xc4734`), so these indices include surrogate code units. Do not normalize
line endings or use Rust scalar offsets before resolving stored ranges.

This is also the model and body/drawing ordinal behavior, not only a helper's
convention. Model `TextCommonParaHandler::GetParagraphCount`, `0x402cfc`,
increments for each CR/LF at `0x402d50`–`0x402d60`;
`ToParagraphStartIndex`, `0x400800`, repeats it at `0x400864`–`0x400874`.
Widget `TextViewUtil::GetParagraphIndex`, `0xdc998`, repeats it at
`0xdca24`–`0xdca34`. The body path's `ObjectTextLayout::textToParagraphs`,
`0xd6638`, checks both units at `0xd67a0`–`0xd67ac`, appends a paragraph
for each, and advances the UTF-16 cursor by one. Drawing
`ObjectTextDrawing::textToParagraphs`, `0x91278`, does the same at
`0x913e8`–`0x914d8`. The corresponding paragraph converters apply stored
ordinal ranges to these records. In raw `a\r\nb`, `b` belongs to ordinal 2,
not 1. Any display policy that coalesces CRLF must retain the native ordinal
mapping separately. Reference fixtures still need to establish whether the
Samsung editor permits/saves raw CRLF or normalizes it during text entry.

There are two inspected paragraph conversion paths:

| Native path | Default and conversion behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Widget `TextLayoutUtil::convertParagraphs`, `0xdb5b8` | Initializes pixel spacing 0 and multiplier `1.3f` at `0xdb610`–`0xdb628`; the multiplier's bytes at `0x637c8` are `66 66 a6 3f`. Its `convertParagraphImpl`, `0xdba5c`, stores pixel spacing, before and after spacing directly, with no scale multiplication. |
| Widget `ObjectTextLayout::convertTextParagraphImpl`, `0xd8e38`, and Drawing `ObjectTextDrawing::convertTextParagraphImpl`, `0x92dc0` | Their `textToParagraphs` initializes pixel spacing 0 and multiplier `1.35f` (`0x3faccccd`) at Widget `0xd6680` / `0xd6800` and Drawing `0x912b8` / `0x9144c`. Conversion multiplies pixel line spacing and paragraph before/after spacing by its first float argument; leaves percentage multiplier unscaled. It also resolves indent width using the second float argument. Callers obtain that second argument from `Constant::GetPixels(137)`, `0xd6b2c` / `0x91788`. |

For the second path, Widget's scaling stores are `0xd8ee0`–`0xd8ee4`
(before), `0xd9014`–`0xd9018` (after), `0xd9178`–`0xd917c` (pixels).
Drawing's equivalents are `0x92e68`, `0x92fa0`, `0x93104`. Percentage
stores are `0xd9004` / `0x92f90`. The first path's 1.3 multiplier must not
be asserted as the default of every editor/body/export route without tracing
the selected caller. Neither path proves a native fallback of `font_size * 1.6`.

Text `TextUtil::GetLineSpacing`, `0x8e180`, computes `pixels` when nonzero,
otherwise `(multiplier - 1) * metric`. `GetLineHeightWithSpacing`, `0x8e100`,
adds that amount to a base height. Thus a pixel value is extra spacing in
this helper, not an absolute line height. If the result exceeds the supplied
limit, it marks the overflow flag and returns the original base height
(`0x8e12c`–`0x8e170`). The precise source of the metric and limit arguments,
first/last-line policy and mixed-font baseline aggregation remain unverified;
do not substitute font size for the metric and call the result parity.

## Measurement, body flow and embedded objects

Text `TextPaintImplSkia::getFontMetrics`, `0x7c16c`, calls
`SkPaint::getFontMetrics` at `0x7c1ac`; `getFontSpacing`, `0x7c290`, delegates
to the same backend. The library includes Minikin font-family/collection
implementations, fallback registration (`SystemFonts::RegisterFallback`,
`0x88d98`) and language fallback registration (`FontListParser::
RegisterSystemFallbackForLanguage`, `0x804ac`). `RichTextLayout::
SetLineBreakIndex`, `0x73c3c`, uses an ICU break handle. This supports measured
font advances, shaping/fallback and language-aware breaking; it does not
establish a particular fallback font order on the Samsung reference device.

Drawing `ObjectDrawing::drawTextContent`, `0x80818`, constructs an
`ObjectTextDrawing` at `0x80ac8` for positioned object text. Bodytext
`BodyTextLayout::onLayoutText`, `0xb1928`, sets the shared `ObjectTextLayout`
width at `0xb1a2c`, updates obstacles, updates text and invokes measurement
at `0xb1a40`–`0xb1a68`. Its `createObjectLayout`, `0xb09d0`, obtains the
embedded object from an `ObjectSpan` at `0xb0a10`, and creates/reuses a
separate object layout. `newObjectLayout`, `0xb30a0`, calls
`ObjectLayoutFactory::CreateObjectLayout` at `0xb3130`.

Bodytext `BodyTextPageIndexer::UpdateTextRangeOnEachPage`, `0xb77a4`,
walks measured lines through `isDownLine` / `isUpLine`, writes page line
ranges at `0xb7978`, and derives page text ranges at `0xb7980`–`0xb79f4`.
Pagination depends on measured line positions and document geometry, not
just splitting the string into equal chunks. The SDK can retain saved page
text sections while developing one Rust layout engine, but recomputed page
breaks and obstacle/inline-object behavior still require reference cases.

## Evidence required before claiming visual parity

- A Samsung-exported standalone text box and reference PDF covering margins,
  vertical gravity, rotation, wrapping and all text-area modes. Existing
  standalone cases are synthetic parser/renderer tests.
- Mixed font sizes/families and overlapping nonempty styles, including emoji,
  combining marks, RTL text and CJK fallback; verify actual selected fonts,
  advances, baseline metrics and break positions.
- Pixel/percentage line spacing, before/after spacing, indent and justified
  paragraphs in both positioned text and body flow. Resolve the context scale
  and default spacing of each captured export route.
- Inline images/tables/code, obstacle wrapping, explicit page breaks and
  multipage text. Preserve raw UTF-16 and paragraph ranges through measurement,
  pagination and export; ranges are not interchangeable with glyph clusters.

These rules can become Rust contract tests backed by the addresses above.
Captured Samsung output remains reference evidence; it need not become a
second authored layout implementation.
